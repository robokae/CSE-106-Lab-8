# CSE-106-Lab-8

Gradebook web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features. Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.

## Getting Started

* After cloning, create a Python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv` and activate it using `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS and Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. Next, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies (e.g., Flask) within the virtual environment.

* Run the command `flask run` to load up the development server and view the web application on the browser.
